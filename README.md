## Abstract

This work reports the study of video generative models for interactive video game generation and simulation. We discuss and explore the use of available pre-trained open-sourced video generation models to create playable interactive video games. While being able to generate short clips of broad range of described scenes, such models still lack controllability and continuity. Given these limitations, we focus on producing and demonstrating a reliable and controllable video game generator on a single game domain. We present **MarioVGG**, a text-to-video diffusion model for controllable video generation on the Super Mario Bros game. **MarioVGG** demonstrates the ability to continously generate consistent and meaningful scenes and levels, as well as simulate the physics and movements of a controllable player all through video.
